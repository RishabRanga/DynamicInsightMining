1.Averaging out ep_month score_month for the entire year by multiplying the sum of all months by 1/12
or 0.08333
2.Split to test and training set.
3.chose an appropriate model and built a decision tree.
4.generate decision tree code using getcode
5.Manually observe increase in Renewed outputs from the code.Accordingly observe features that results 
in increase and print output.
6.The traversal function dynamically gives insights at every node and tells alternatives to increase chances of renewal.



goqiiinsightengineforretentonteam-2.ipynb-This is a file which gives insights by traversing a decision tree for each user based on his feature values
